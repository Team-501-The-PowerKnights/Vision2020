# Contributing

Hello and thank you for contributing to Team 501 the PowerKnight's vision program! Below are some rules regarding contributing to this repo. Please read this before making a PR and  especially before pushing master.

## Team Member

If you are a member of the team you have full push access to the repo. This means that you can push to the repo without having to fork it and make a PR from that fork to the master branch. So the following process should take place when you want to make changes to the program:

1. Make an issue 
    * Clear description of what your trying to solve
    * Assigned to your self or another member
    * Add tags that align with the goal of the issue
2. Make a branch with a name that clearly defines what feature you are trying to add/bug you are trying to fix
3. Commit you changes to that branch
4. Make your PR
    * Set @ionigman and @dither as reviewers
    * Close issue from PR with the following in your description: `This PR resolves {NUMBER OF ISSUE GOES HERE}`
5. Once all the checks have passed wait for one of the reviewers to approve and then your clear to merge you branch!
6. Delete the branch that you created for the PR

## Outside member

Same process for a team member except you need to fork the repo and then make your PR from that Fork. You also don't have access to putting tags or reviewers to your PR.

Thank you again!
